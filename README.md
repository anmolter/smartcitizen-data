Welcome to the iScape Sensor Analysis Framework. The framework is built with the purpose of helping on the calibration process of the sensors on field tests and it aim to be the primary tool for manipulating the sensors data.

The primary goal of the tools is to help us validate the different iScape sensors and calculate their calibration values that later might automatically applied to the data the sensors push online.
