#### Preliminary Checks

##### Data stationarity

We will use the Dicker-fuller test (ADF) test to verify the data is stationary. We need to check data stationarity for certain type of models. 

If the process is stationary means it doesnâ€™t change its statistical properties over time: mean and variance do not change over time (constancy of variance is also called homoscedasticity), also covariance function does not depend on the time (should only depend on the distance between observations) Source [here](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course/open-machine-learning-course-topic-9-time-series-analysis-in-python-a270cb05e0b3). Visually:

- Growing mean --> Non stationary

- Varying time covariance --> Non stationary

- Null Hypothesis (H0): If failed to be rejected, it suggests the time series has a unit root, meaning it is non-stationary. It has some time dependent structure.
- Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The null hypothesis is rejected; it suggests the time series does not have a unit root, meaning it is stationary. It does not have time-dependent structure.

We interpret this result using the p-value from the test. A p-value below a threshold (such as 5% or 1%) suggests we reject the null hypothesis (stationary), otherwise a p-value above the threshold suggests we fail to reject the null hypothesis (non-stationary). Hence:

- p-value > 0.05: fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0), the data has an unit root and is non-stationary.
- p-value <= 0.05: reject the null hypothesis (H0), the data does not have an unit root and is stationary.

##### Autocorrelation

High levels of autocorrelation can indicate our time series is shows seasonality. We will use the ACF plot to identify possible autocorrelation and potentially include differentiation.

##### Granger Casuality Test (use with caution)

This test is useful to determine the casuality of variables and determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. 

The Null hypothesis for granger causality tests is that the time series in the second column, x2, does NOT Granger cause the time series in the first column, x1. Grange causality means that past values of x2 have a statistically significant effect on the current value of x1, taking past values of x1 into account as regressors. We reject the null hypothesis that x2 does not Granger cause x1 if the pvalues are below a desired size of the test. Hence:

- p-value < size: allows to reject the null hypothesis (H0) for x1 = f(x2)
- p-value > size: we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0) for x1 = f(x2)

The null hypothesis for all four test is that the coefficients corresponding to past values of the second time series are zero.
